## How do wake timers work

Windows most commonly places a computer in S3 (standby/save-to-RAM) mode, where power is cut from the CPU but not to RAM.

If power is cut to the CPU, then how are wake timers triggered? Which component knows when to automatically wake the computer up?

If it is in the BIOS, how does Windows inform the BIOS of the next wakeup time?



#### Best Answer

This is done via the "alarm" registers in the [RTC (real-time clock)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock). On the original PC-AT, this chip was a Motorola MC146818.

Before going to sleep (ACPI S3), the kernel will program the next-scheduled wake-up time into the "alarm" registers on the RTC, which is always powered-on. When this wake-up time arrives, the RTC will trigger the chipset to power-on the system, and resume from S3. (Note that in most modern systems, the RTC is actually part of the southbridge itself, so the power-on signalling happens internally).

After the system resumes from sleep, the kernel will evaluate its list of pending wake events, dispatching the ones that have arrived.

This paper from Intel describes the interface (for x86 systems):

The programming of these registers is done in the Linux kernel in [`cmos_set_alarm`](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/rtc/rtc-cmos.c?v=4.1#L329).

I've struggled with this problem before, and have only been able to do it on one of my PCs.

Some things to try:

- Does your PC have a wake timer feature in the BIOS? If not, it may not be capable of waking up to a schedule.
- Try changing the Bios sleep modes, i.e. S1, S2 etc.
- Also, the one PC I can wake up to a schedule has ACPI 2.0 enabled in the BIOS. (Not sure if that is relevant or not.)

Sorry I can't give you a definitive solution.



##### [Windows – How to prevent the Windows 10 “Maintenance Activator” from waking the PC randomly (even after disabling wake timers)](https://super-unix.com/superuser/how-to-prevent-the-windows-10-maintenance-activator-from-waking-the-pc-randomly-even-after-disabling-wake-timers/)

The first step is to deactivate Wake Timers in your power saving profile. To do this, go to PowerOptions > Advanced Settings > Sleep > Allow Wake Timers > Setting: Disabled.

Next go to Control Panel > System and Security > Security and Maintenance > expand Maintenance section > click on Change maintenance settings. Uncheck the option that allows the PC to wake up. You may need to change the time first, or the option will stay unchecked but the task will remain armed. This may not happen, but it is possible.

This will disable the Maintenance Activator. If this does not work, there is another fix.

First, open Regedit. Then navigate to the following registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\Maintenance`. If this doesn't exist, create it. Create a 32 bit DWORD value named MaintenanceDisabled, if it is not already there. Set it to 1. Then reboot your computer. This will disable the automatic maintenance.
